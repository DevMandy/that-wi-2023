# that-wi-2023
The repo hosts my slides from my THAT Conference WI, 2023. CI/CD—It's not just for DevOps!

### Details
CI/CD pipelines help development teams ship code faster and with higher quality, but they can be intimidating if you’ve never worked with them before. Never fear! This talk has you covered.

## We’ll start from the beginning and cover the following:
* Define CI and CD (both CDs, yes there are two!)
* Explain the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment (Spoiler Alert: these are the two CDs in CI/CD)
* Learn how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using the most popular CI/CD tools
* Discuss best practices for configuring your repos to automatically trigger tests when pull requests are open
* Talk about the benefits of short-lived branches and frequent deployments

You’ll walk away with relevant suggestions for improving your software development life cycle, provided in small chunks that can be added incrementally and chosen a la carte!

## Prerequisites
To best enjoy this talk, you should have some knowledge of the software development life cycle. You don't need to be familiar with any particular programming language or even how to write code at all. This talk is very accessible to attendees with varying degrees of technical skills.

## Take Aways
Understand CI/CD
Learn how to deliver software faster and with higher quality
Learn the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment
Learn how to setup a CI/CD pipeline to trigger tests when pull requests are open
